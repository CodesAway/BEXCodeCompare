Flow of code to get to compare

0) In plugin.xml, extension point org.eclipse.compare.contentMergeViewers
a) Defines the IViewerCreator class
b) Fos us, that's JavaContentViewerCreator 

1) JavaContentViewerCreator (creates new JavaMergeViewer)
2) JavaMergeViewer (calls super constructor)

3) TextMergeViewer
a) Creates DocumentMerger, which will ultimately call the diff code
b) Has fSavedDiff field which stores the diff (set from fCurrentDiff in TextMergeViewer.saveDiff())
c) Has fCurrentDiff field 

... not really following how it gets called, but eventually we do the diff

4) Calls TextMergeViewer.doDiff()
5) Calls DocumentMerger.doDiff()
6) Calls RangeDifferencer.findRanges(IProgressMonitor, IRangeComparator, IRangeComparator, IRangeComparator)
7) Calls RangeDifferencer.findRanges(AbstractRangeDifferenceFactory, IProgressMonitor, IRangeComparator, IRangeComparator, IRangeComparator)


For a 2-way compare (no ancestor)
1) Calls RangeDifferencer.findRanges(AbstractRangeDifferenceFactory, IProgressMonitor, IRangeComparator, IRangeComparator)
2) Calls RangeDifferencer.findDifferences(AbstractRangeDifferenceFactory, IProgressMonitor, IRangeComparator, IRangeComparator)
a) Eclipse calls RangeComparatorLCS.findDifferences(AbstractRangeDifferenceFactory, IProgressMonitor, IRangeComparator, IRangeComparator)
b) My plugin will call RangeComparatorBEX.findDifferences(AbstractRangeDifferenceFactory, IProgressMonitor, IRangeComparator, IRangeComparator)
c) BEX is the Be Enhanced Code Compare

For a 3-way compare (with ancestor)
XXX: currently not working with BEX (shows entire file as conflict; I'm not sure why)
RangeDifferencer.findRanges(AbstractRangeDifferenceFactory, IProgressMonitor, IRangeComparator, IRangeComparator, IRangeComparator, boolean)

Questions:

1) Where does it do the backtrack to determine the LCS?
Likely done somewhere in RangeComparatorBEX.getDifferences(SubMonitor, AbstractRangeDifferenceFactory)

IRangeComparator:
1) How is it used?
a) Contains number of lines - this.comparator.getRangeCount()
b) Determine if two lines are equal -  this.comparator1.rangesEqual(i1, this.comparator2, i2);

2) What is the concrete class
DocLineComparator for DocumentMerger class


LCS:
1) LCS.lcs_rec
a) Mentions Myer's and snake
b) BEX instead uses Patience / Myers versus LCS / Myers
c) This also explains why comparing long files is so time consuming, since using LCS O(n^2) versus Linear Myer's, which I use





Tested scroll logic, seems to work, but reveal works just as well

			// Based on logic from setCurrentDiff and revealDiff
			if (this.fSynchronizedScrolling && !this.fSynchronizedScrolling) {
				int vpos = leftLineNumber;
				int rvpos;
				int lvpos;
				int avpos;
				MergeSourceViewer allButThis = null;

				avpos = lvpos = rvpos = vpos;

				int delta = this.fRight.getViewportLines() / 4;
				avpos -= delta;
				if (avpos < 0) {
					avpos = 0;
				}
				lvpos -= delta;
				if (lvpos < 0) {
					lvpos = 0;
				}
				rvpos -= delta;
				if (rvpos < 0) {
					rvpos = 0;
				}

				// TODO: doesn't work perfectly
				// May need to factor in fact that due ty my handling of whitespace, line matching isn't 1-1
				// TODO: see if I can figure out how to have the correct position on left and right
				// Mainly think I need to figure if the right line needs to have a delta

				this.scrollVertical(avpos, lvpos, rvpos, allButThis);

				if (this.fVScrollBar != null) {
					this.fVScrollBar.setSelection(avpos);
				}

				this.fRight.setSelection(rightPosition);
			} else {
				reveal(mergeSourceViewer, position);
			}

# BEX Code Compare
BEX Code Compare is a library and Eclipse plugin, which uses Patience sort / Myers diff and some post diff processing to yield an enhanced code compare

The library has no dependency on Eclipse and can be used in commercial or private projects.

## Maven Dependency
**Tip**: you only need to specify one of the following. For example, if you include **becr.examples**, it has a transitive dependency for **bex** and **becr**.

    <dependency>
        <groupId>info.codesaway</groupId>
        <artifactId>bex</artifactId>
        <version>0.11.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>info.codesaway</groupId>
        <artifactId>becr</artifactId>
        <version>0.11.0</version>
    </dependency>
    
    <dependency>
        <groupId>info.codesaway</groupId>
        <artifactId>becr.examples</artifactId>
        <version>0.9.0</version>

## How does it work?

### BEX Code Compare
First we use Patience sort / Myers diff (similar to how GitHub does a compare). Then, we take the resulting diff and do some post diff processing to group the differences into groups of changes.

### BEX Code Matching
BEX Matching performs structured code matching to offer an enhanced find and replace for your code

For example, match an **if** branch with a simple pattern.

    if (:[condition]) { :[stuff] }
    
BEX will ensure the parentheses and braces are balanced, and that you're not looking at commented out code. I like to think of it as a code friendly regular expression. Of course, if you want to mix regex in your pattern, that's supported too.

### BEX Code Refactoring
BECR uses BEX and Eclipe's JDT to parse Java code and provide parsing and refactoring functionality. There are examples available to show how BECR could be used.

## How does the Eclipse plugin work?

* We start with the BEX library and the functionality it provides outside of an IDE
* Then, the BEX Eclipse plugin identifies important versus non important changes (such as a line being split across multiple lines if ignoring whitespace differences)
* Finally, BEX shows an Eclipse view with the changes

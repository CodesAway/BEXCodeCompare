## How does it work?

First we use Patience sort / Myers diff (similar to how GitHub does a compare). Then, we take the resulting diff and do some post diff processing to group the differences into groups of changes.

Along the way, BEX identifies important versus non important changes (such as a line being split across multiple lines if ignoring whitespace differences). It then shows an Eclipse view with the changes.

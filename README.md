BEX Code Compare is a library and Eclipse plugin, which uses Patience sort / Myers diff and some post diff processing to yield an enhanced code compare

The library has no dependency on Eclipse and can be used in commercial or private projects.

## What is BEX Code Compare?
BEX Code Compare is **B**e **E**nhanced **Ï½C** Code Compare

<a name="becr"></a>
## What is BECR?
BECR, pronounced Beccer, is **B**e **E**nhanced **C**ode **R**efactoring

<a name="how"></a>
## How does it work?

First we use Patience sort / Myers diff (similar to how GitHub does a compare). Then, we take the resulting diff and do some post diff processing to group the differences into groups of changes.

BECR uses BEX and Eclipe's JDT to parse Java code and provide parsing and refactoring functionality. There are examples available to show how BECR could be used.

## How does the Eclipse plugin work?

* We start with the BEX library and the functionality it provides outside of an IDE
* Then, the BEX Eclipse plugin identifies important versus non important changes (such as a line being split across multiple lines if ignoring whitespace differences)
* Finally, BEX shows an Eclipse view with the changes
